# üö© CTF Backend

A Capture The Flag (CTF) competition backend built with Express.js and Node.js. This application provides a comprehensive platform for hosting cybersecurity challenges, managing user authentication, tracking scores, and real-time updates through WebSocket connections.

## üìã Project Overview

This CTF backend serves as the foundation for cybersecurity competitions, providing:

- **User Management**: Registration, authentication, and profile management
- **Challenge System**: Multi-category cybersecurity challenges with dynamic scoring
- **Admin Dashboard**: Administrative controls for managing competitions, users, and challenges
- **Real-time Features**: Live scoreboards and notifications via WebSockets
- **Secure Architecture**: JWT-based authentication with role-based access control
